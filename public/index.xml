      <description>Introduction, Data, and MethodsIn this project, we are going to analyse data about Airbnb listings and fit a model to predict the total cost for two people staying 4 nights in an Airbnb in a city. Our data comes from insideairbnb.com; it was originally scraped from airbnb.com.
# Load datalistings &amp;lt;- vroom(&amp;quot;http://data.insideairbnb.com/belgium/bru/brussels/2020-06-15/data/listings.csv.gz&amp;quot;)Some important variables are as follows:</description>

      <title>Capital Asset Pricing Model</title>

      <description>Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is one of the most important models in finance and is the basic of many investment theorys. The model is specified as Ri=Rf+β(Rm-Rf)+e, where Ri is return of stock i, Rm is market average return, and Rf is riskfree rate. In investment evaluation, we always split our return into two parts: alpha return and beta return. Beta return is the incentive of taking systematic market risk and alpha return is generated by investors’ ability.</description>

      <description>When covid-19 outbreak, we have entered a new normal with low yield. Under the circumstances, many investors go into a dilemma. On one hand, to hunt for high-yield, investors should add risk to portfolio. On the other hand, with geopolitical risks, covid-19, and economic recession, there are so many uncertainties forward. To solve this dilemma, I think one important step is diversify into alternatives. In this blog, let’s see how alternatives benefit our asset allocation.</description>

      <description>In the long term, asset prices reflect economic fundamentals. One important part in asset allocation is economic analysis. In this session, I will show my work on the breakdown of GDP, one of the most important economic indicators.
The main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). My data comes from United Nations’ National Accounts Main Aggregates Database, which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today.</description>

      <title>Merger Arbitrage</title>

      <description>Merger Arbitrage is an event driven strategy, whose returns are dependent on the completion of merger/acquisition. At the time of the deal announcement, there is a risk that the deal will not be finalised. For hedge fund managers, analysing which kind of deals are more likely to succeed is very important. In this blog, I am going to analyse the success rate of deals within different categories. I mainly focus on type of bids, payment methods, type of deals, value of transaction, and event firms’ industries.</description>

      <title>Strategic Asset Allocation</title>

      <description>I am more comfortable with top-down investment style. The first step to construct the portfolio is asset allocation. In this blog, I construct the equities-bonds portfolio and compare traditional 60/40 portfolio with risk parity portfolio. My ideas come from the final question in midterm of Investment Fundamental course which is taught by professor Roberto Gomez Cram. My data comes from J.P. Morgan Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions.
