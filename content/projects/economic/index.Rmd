> In the long term, asset prices reflect economic fundamentals. One important part in asset allocation is economic analysis. In this session, I will show my work on the breakdown of GDP, one of the most important economic indicators.

The main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). My data comes from [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. I will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file I will work with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6) and it has already been saved in the Data directory. 

# Data Initialization

```{r read_GDP_data}

UN_GDP_data<-read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), 
                        sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                        skip=2) # Number of rows to skip

```

The first step is to tidy this dataset, as it is in wide format so I will make it into long, tidy format. I also express all figures in billions and rename some variables into something shorter.


```{r reshape_GDP_data}

tidy_GDP_data<-UN_GDP_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols="1970":"2017",
               names_to="year",
               values_to="value") %>%
  mutate(value=value/1e9) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from="IndicatorName",
              values_from="value") %>%
  
  # Rename and select variables
  rename(GDP="Gross Domestic Product (GDP)",
         C="Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)",
         I="Gross capital formation",
         G="General government final consumption expenditure",
         EX="Exports of goods and services",
         IM="Imports of goods and services") %>%
  select("Country","year","GDP","C","I","G","EX","IM") %>%
     
  # Create a new variable `NX` (net export) equals to EX-IM
  mutate(NX=EX-IM)  

# Convert character format `year` to numeric
tidy_GDP_data$year<-as.numeric(tidy_GDP_data$year)
           
glimpse(tidy_GDP_data)

# Let us compare GDP components for these 3 countries
country_list <- c("United States","United Kingdom","Japan","China","India","Brazil")

economic_data<-tidy_GDP_data %>%
  filter(Country %in% country_list) %>%
  
  # Though the panel data as `tidy_GDP_data` is much easier to read and conduct econometric analysis, here long format dataset makes it easier to create the following two plots.
  pivot_longer(cols="GDP":"NX",
               names_to="indicator",
               values_to="value")

```


# GDP components over time

In this blog, I only focus on three countries: United States, United Kingdom, Japan, China, India, and Brazil. The first three are developed countries while the other three are developing countries. 


```{r,fig.width=8,fig.height=6}

# To make sure the right order
economic_data$indicator<-factor(economic_data$indicator,levels=c("I","EX","G","C","IM","GDP","NX"))
economic_data$Country<-factor(economic_data$Country,levels=c("United States","United Kingdom","Japan","China","India","Brazil"))

economic_data %>%
  
  # Select only necessary variables
  filter(indicator!="GDP"&indicator!="NX") %>%
  
  # Create the plot
  ggplot(aes(x=year,y=value,group=indicator,colour=indicator))+
  geom_line()+
  facet_wrap("Country")+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(1970,1980,1990,2000,2010))+
  
  # Change the content of legend
  scale_colour_hue("Components of GDP",labels=c("Gross captial formation","Exports","Government expenditure","Household expenditure","Imports"))+
  
  labs(title="GDP components over time",
       subtitle="In constant 2010 USD",
       x=NULL,
       y="Billion US$")+
  theme_bw(base_size=9)


```

As we can see from the chart, United States is the country with highest GDP and it's mainly driven by household expenditure. Two developing countries, India and Brail, have relatively lower GDP. Although China is also a developing country, its economic aggregate is huge. We can also see China's rapid economic growth since 1970.

Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption *C*), Gross Capital Formation (business investment *I*), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator `Gross Domestic Product (GDP)` in my dataframe, I  calculate it given its components discussed above. Using `skim`, we can see on average there are 0.4% difference between GDP I calculated and the GDP figure included in the dataframe.

```{r}

# I will do all data manipulation in this panel dataset
tidy_GDP_data<-tidy_GDP_data %>%
  
  # Calculate GDP by adding up its components
  mutate(GDP_calculated=C+I+G+NX,
         diff=round(GDP_calculated/GDP-1,4))
  
# Present summary statistics of `diff` which is the difference between GDP calculated and original GDP figure
skim(tidy_GDP_data$diff)


```


Finally, I also plot GDP components in terms of %. 

```{r,fig.width=8,fig.height=6}

# Calculate the proportion of each component
economy_data2<-tidy_GDP_data %>%
  mutate(G_proportion=round(G/GDP_calculated,3),
         I_proportion=round(I/GDP_calculated,3),
         C_proportion=round(C/GDP_calculated,3),
         NX_proportion=round(NX/GDP_calculated,3)) %>%
  select("Country","year","G_proportion","I_proportion","C_proportion","NX_proportion") %>%
  filter(Country %in% country_list) %>%

  # Again, i make it into long format because it's easier to create the plot
  pivot_longer(cols="G_proportion":"NX_proportion",
               names_to="indicator",
               values_to="value")

# To make sure the right order
economy_data2$indicator<-factor(economy_data2$indicator,levels=c("G_proportion","I_proportion","C_proportion","NX_proportion"))
economy_data2$Country<-factor(economy_data2$Country,levels=c("United States","United Kingdom","Japan","China","India","Brazil"))

# Create the plot
economy_data2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year,y=value,group=indicator,colour=indicator))+
  geom_line()+
  facet_wrap(~Country)+
  
  # Make y-axis labels into percentage
  scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent)+
  
  # Change the content of legend
  scale_colour_hue(NULL,labels=c("Government expenditure","Gross captial formation","Household expenditure","Net Exports"))+
  
  labs(title="GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars",
       x=NULL,
       y="proportion",
       caption="Source: United Nations, https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads")+
  theme_bw(base_size=8)

```


The last chart shows different economic fundamentals of these countries. Household expenditure is the key component of GDP (more than 50%) in most countries, except for China. In recent years, investment became the key driver of China economy. Many economists start worrying about China's insufficient consumption, which is the main reason that GDP growth rate in China has been falling for years. With capital market revolution and supply-side reform, China economy is current facing the shift from high-speed growth driven by manufacturing to high-quality growth driven by consumption. If the proportion of consumption can rise, China may face another economic prosperity. The proportion of household expenditure is also falling in India, but still above 50%.

China and India are two countries that witnessed rapid economic growth in recent years. The key driving force is investment. As developing countries with great growth potential, China and India continuously attracting domestic and foreign investment.

From the chart, we can also see China, Japan, and Brazil are trade surplus countries while U.S., U.K., and India are deficit in net exports.
